# Federated_Learning_under_Temporal_Data_Drift
Researched federated learning robustness under temporal data drift using Flower and PyTorch. Simulated seasonal shifts in Fashion-MNIST to test model adaptation as client data evolved. Implemented FedAvg with configurable client selection and local epochs, comparing centralized and FL baselines.


# The data:

| |--- PetImages

| | |--- Cat (Contains 12491 images)

| | |--- Dog (Contains 12470 images)
