# Federated_Learning_under_Temporal_Data_Drift
Researched federated learning robustness under temporal data drift using Flower and PyTorch. Simulated seasonal shifts in Fashion-MNIST to test model adaptation as client data evolved. Implemented FedAvg with configurable client selection and local epochs, comparing centralized and FL baselines.
